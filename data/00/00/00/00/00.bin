----[Release Notes]-------------------------------------:

Fairune Collection includes four games in one package - 
Fairune, Fairune 2, Fairune Origin and Fairune Blast!

Fairune is a retro-styled adventure RPG. Our heroine 
embarks upon a journey to unlock three mysterious 
statues and seal away a great evil. Throughout the 
journey she will need to solve puzzles, fight monsters,
discover new weapons and improve her abilities.

Fairune 2 brings our heroine back for another perilous 
quest, this time to find a lost fairy. This sequel 
delivers a bigger world for those that are ready for 
the challenge.

Fairune Origin, being released for the first time, 
offers an intriguing look at the beginnings of the IP. 
It provides a short but fun adventure and illustrates 
how SKIPMORE conceptualised the gameplay of the two 
games that followed.

Fairune Blast is an unlockable treat, meanwhile, to 
offer something completely different. It's a colourful 
shoot-em-up, perfect for pick-up-and-play action on 
Nintendo Switch!

Features:

- Fairune and Fairune 2 have re-designed user interfaces 
for Nintendo Switch.

- Explore, solve puzzles, level up and fight monsters 
on your journeys.

- Simple controls make it accessible to all players ready
for adventure!

- Fairune Origin and Fairune Blast make their console 
debut and bring the game total to 4!

- Retro 8-bit style visuals, designed for the modern 
era.

- Perfect for headphones with a catchy chiptune 
soundtrack.
